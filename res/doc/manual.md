## 1. Introduction

EvrSim is a python based calculation engine which cansimulate everything with visual math models you built.

In our universe, we can easily find out that lots of things are relavant. For example, the apple falls due to universal gravity, and gravity comes from mass and gravity field, which means that we can know how fast the apple falls by calculating its mass and the Earth's mass using three laws of Newton.

Everything is relavant. Find their relationship, and simulate them with EvrSim.
